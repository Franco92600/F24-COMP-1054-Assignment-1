                    It's nine o'clock on a Saturday<br>
                    The regular crowd shuffles in<br>
                    There's an old man sittin' next to me<br>
                    Makin' love to his tonic and gin<br>
                    He says, "Son, can you play me a memory?<br>
                    I'm not really sure how it goes<br>
                    But it's sad, and it's sweet, and I knew it complete<br>
                    When I wore a younger man's clothes"<br>
                </p>
                <p class="refrain">
                    La, la-la, di-dee-da<br>
                    La-la, di-dee-da da-dum<br>
                </p>
                <p class="chorus">
                    Sing us a song, you're the <span class="pianoman">Piano Man</span><br>
                    Sing us a song tonight<br>
                    Well, we're all in the mood for a melody<br>
                    And you've got us feelin' alright<br>

                    Now John at the bar is a friend of mine<br>
                    He gets me my drinks for free<br>
                    And he's quick with a joke, or to light up your smoke<br>
                    But there's someplace that he'd rather be<br>
                    He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me"<br>
                    As the smile ran away from his face<br>
                    "Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star<br>
                    If I could get out of this place"<br>

                    Now Paul is a real estate novelist<br>
                    Who never had time for a wife<br>
                    And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the navy<br>
                    And probably will be for life<br>
                    And the waitress is practicing politics<br>
                    As the businessmen slowly get stoned<br>
                    Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness<br>
                    But it's better than drinkin' alone<br>

                    It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday<br>
                    And the manager gives me a smile<br>
                    'Cause he knows that it's me they've been comin' to see<br>
                    To forget about life for a while<br>
                    And the piano, it sounds like a carnival<br>
                    And the microphone smells like a beer<br>
                    And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar<br>
                    And say, "Man, what are you doin' here?"<br>
                </p>
